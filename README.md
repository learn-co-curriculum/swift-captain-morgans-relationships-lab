# Captain Morgans Relationships

## Instructions
  0. The storyboard has been started for you. Your class file names should match those designated here.
  1. Navigate to the `swift_captain_morgans_relationships_lab.xcdatamodeld`.
  2. Create three entities with attributes and relationships: Pirate, Ship, Engine.
    * Pirates have many ships, and a name.
    * Ships have one Pirate, one Engine, and a name.
    * Engines have an `String` attribute describing its propulsion type (i.e. sail, gas, or electric) and one ship. 
  3. In your dataStore, write the implementation for `generateTestData` and `fetchData`.  
  8. Make sure everything shows up!

## Advanced

1. Add two plus `UIBarButtonItems`. One on `PiratesViewController` and one on `ShipsViewController`. When you click the plus it should modally present a new view controller that allows the user to add either a new pirate, or a new ship (which needs an engine and should be associated with a pirate!) to the database.
